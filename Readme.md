# The Shelf Detector System For Retail Stores Using Object Detection



### How to run the Code

First install the requirements.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
**Note**: If you face issues in installing dlib. I suggest to refer to dlib documentation for further help on installation.

Then to run the demo please run the following command:

```
python train_obj_detector.py testNutella1
```
Ideally if everything runs smoothly, you should be able to see the window showing the image detector window and the window showing images where nutella is getting detected and the counts in the commandline.
